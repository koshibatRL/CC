# Why I built it

As a job seeker myself, I struggled to keep track of multiple applications and interview feedback. Spreadsheets weren't cutting it, so I built this tool to help myself and others in the same situation.

# Looking for feedback on

* UI/UX design - is it intuitive?
* Feature suggestions - what would make this more useful?
* AI insights - are there other analytics that would be helpful?
* Potential monetization strategies - would you pay for premium features?

# Development Journey

* Developed in just 1 day using Claude Sonnet 3.7
* As a Python/ML background developer with zero prior web application experience
* Leveraged AI assistance to rapidly prototype and build a full-stack application

# AI-Powered Development Insights

Building this project was a fascinating journey of AI-assisted development. Coming from a Python and Machine Learning background with no prior web development experience, I was able to create a full-featured web application in just one day, primarily by using Claude Sonnet 3.7 as a coding partner.

# Future AI-Enhanced Features I'm Exploring

I'm looking to leverage my ML and LLM background to add some cutting-edge features. Some ideas I'm considering:

* Advanced job application prediction models
* AI-powered resume optimization
* Personalized interview preparation chatbot
* Automated cover letter generation
* Sentiment analysis of interview feedback
* Skill gap analysis based on job applications
